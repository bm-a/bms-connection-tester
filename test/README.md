# test/ — automated tests (28/28 passing)

Each subdirectory is an independent Unity test app (PlatformIO convention),
also compilable with plain `g++` (see `run_tests.sh` fallback).

- `test_checksum/` (7) — checksum vectors incl. real captures (`FFFD`, `FCDA`,
  `FCA8`, `FA86`, `F65A` from `captures/SOC-DOCKLIGHT.xlsx`), golden-frame
  byte-exactness, strict matcher vs 1-byte corruptions.
- `test_logic/` (8) — adaptive green window: boot red, green on polls, red after
  silence, self-heal, slow-poll adaptation, 2 s floor / 10 s cap, rollover safety.
- `test_parser/` (13) — full-frame parser (reads/writes/split/corrupt/resync/
  overlong), dispatcher option-A silence, canned-frame checksum self-consistency,
  1 M-byte fuzz (zero false frames), fast + slow poll soaks.

Run: `pio test -e native` (or `sh ../run_tests.sh`).
